### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a basic investing program that shows how monthly deposits can impact the overall growth of an investment versus a single, initial deposit alone.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think that overall my code was extremely clear and concise, as well as using .cpp and .h files apporpriately.  This was my first assignment of which I tried to keep the main.cpp clear of as much excess code as possible, and I think I was able to acheive that.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think I could have done a better job with error handling.  I think that the 3rd project of the term gave me a better grasp on the importance and implementation of error handling, so if I had to go back and improve the code, I would focus on that.  

### Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I have to admit I did do alot of googling to figure out the best what to maniuplate the code the way I wanted it to work.  I learned a lot about #include statement, and using certain libraries, I was able to achieve the results I wanted to.  Honestly, I think just having the ability to search or troubleshoot my problems through the internet in general has proven most valuble.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

This was the program that I used seperate source and header files apart from the main.cpp.  Knowing how to use seperate files is foundational knowledge to programming and so being able to successfully implement this will help immensely for other courses and projects in the future.  This was also the first project that I had to build from the ground up, so successfully understand C++ styling and common naming semantics will also prove valubale in the future.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Sticking to the syling guielines set forth in the project specs makes this program easy to maintain because a fellow programmer would be able to easy follow after me and update the file as needed.  The styling guides also help with readability and makes it easy to adapt and update as needed.

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wants to develop a web-based game that is available on multiple platforms from their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which currently is only available on Android. The development for the web-based version is being outsource to our team to help streamline the process.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think that I had a good grasp on the UML class diagram as well as the coding itself in the project, I think that it was easy to understand and follow as well as where to go with the code from the document.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I really liked delving into the different specifications of the operating systems (more specifically the chart). I think it really helped me understand what the big differences are between the main operating systems that can be found desktop/laptops.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I probably would have had to go with fixing the code a bit more to make sure that it ran properly.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The client wanted to make sure that the game has the ability to have or more teams, each team will need to have players assigned to it, each team and game names must be unique, and only one instance of a game can exist at a give time. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because their goals for functionaity are what is most important to a project. If the app doesn't function like the user wants it to, then the project wouldn't be considered a success.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

To design the software, I used the UML diagram as well as the specifications provided to develop the code. I think overall this was a pretty successful approached but I feel like there could have been some improvments made to the process that would have helped with the project in the long run. I think using psuedocode to build a framework from the UML is really helpful for me to understand where to go with the code. I also think that having a better understanding of operating systems will help when it comes to porting applications from one OS to another. Finally, I think that looking back through the different design templates will help with foundational knowledge of design.

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are different features and functionalities that users would want included in a program or solution for a particular task.  The best way to interpret user needs are by creating user stories "As a user I want... so that..." which clearly defines and standardizes user needs in a set template that is easy to understand.  User stories then can be taken then to create test cases to test the functional code for that user story as it is completed.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I going into a coding assignment or project, I look at that the goals or objectives that the code should be able to do at the end of the process.  I usually will set different points throughout the project to test the code before continuing so that I can catch issues that might further set me back if not looked into.  This process is usually repeated until the project is functional and the code is complete.  I think that part of my process is agile in that I usually incrementally break up the project so that I can test the code to make sure that it works properly.  I think that I should spend a bit more time and "standardizing" my goals and objectives by using user stories becuase then I could find better points to stop and test the code based of of each user story.  I also think that QI'ing myself almost like a sprint retrospective after each project and reflect on what could be done better or what I could improve on would help me improve steadily as I continue to comeplete projects and work on different code.  

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think a good team member in software development should have quite a few different qualities that will help someone become a valuable asset to the team.  I think communcation and transparency are both key in software development because making sure questions or concerns are cleared up as timely as possible will only help the team further progress.  Transparency in understanding ones strengths and weaknesses can help develop a better skill set as well as keeps the team on the same page on in terms of who to go to if questions do arise.  Being skilled in coding is very important for the overall product but I think interpersonal skills like communcation are foundational in team developement and success.  I also think having the ability to take constructive feedback and apply them to future processes is also important for a good team member because being able take critiques from others and apply them helps build teama rapport as well as foster realtionships amongst team members.
